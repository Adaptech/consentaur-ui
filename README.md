# git-backed-cqrs

#### An example of an event-sourced CQRS solution in GoLang

There's an old saw about how the only way to really learn something is to actually do it.

I've been following along with the various __CQRS__ projects from the DDD/CQRS/ES Meetup, but this is the first one that really grabbed me.

The premise is relatively simple, perhaps I can contribute. If not I'll certainly learn some Git while tracking progress.
